# used to compute moving average of the DEMAND of the same hour of day and same
# day of week of seven four-week windows. There is a 10 week gap between the
# latest four-week window and the current week, because of the forecasting
# horizon of this problem.
# Second SameWeekOfYearLagFeaturizer is used to compute the moving average
# features of the same week of year of previous 5 years.
# Finally, the load ratios are computed by dividing the moving average DEMAND
# of previous years by the moving average DEMAND of the current year. The
# idea is that there is a correlation between the DEMAND between the
# current time point and earlier time point, and the ratio between the DEMAND
# of earlier time point of previous years and the current year can be used to
# scale the forecasting results of the current year.
